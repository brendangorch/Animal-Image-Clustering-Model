## Summary
- Worked in a team setting to build an unsupervised image clustering system to group images of five animal species using K-Means clustering.
- Preprocessed and extracted features from raw image data for clustering and visualization.
- Used the elbow method and silhouette scores to determine optimal cluster count and evaluate performance.
- Applied feature extraction techniques to improve clustering quality and explored integration with transfer learning.

See Final_Report.pdf for a detailed breakdown on the project.
See Unsupervised_Image_Clustering.ipynb for all of the code and outputs.
